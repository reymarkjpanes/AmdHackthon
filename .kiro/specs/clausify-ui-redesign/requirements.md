# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies requirements for the complete UI redesign of the Clausify AI frontend. The redesign transforms the existing React + TypeScript + Tailwind application from its current electric-blue-on-navy aesthetic into a high-contrast, document-centric design system built around a cyan accent color, physical paper aesthetics, and editorial typography. All four pages (Landing, Dashboard, Chat, Demo) are in scope. Every existing API integration must remain fully functional throughout the redesign.

- **EvidenceBox**: A paper-colored (#F2EFE8) excerpt container used in conflict alerts and AI responses.
- **ConflictAlert**: The banner that shows detected document conflicts with a REDLINE stamp aesthetic and 4px left border in AMD-signal red.
- **AnalysisCardGrid**: The 2×2 grid of analysis result cards on the Dashboard and Demo pages.
- **ThinkingAnimation**: The sequential cyan dots animation shown while the AI is processing.
- **StreamingCursor**: The blinking cursor appended to streaming token output in Chat.

- **RiskBadge**: A small badge indicating HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW risk level.
- **EvidenceTag**: A monospace chip displaying a source filename.
- **API**: The backend REST and SSE endpoints consumed by the frontend.
- **Volt**: The new primary cyan accent color `#00D4FF`.
- **Ink**: The new primary background color `#0C0E14`.
- **Paper**: The warm off-white document color `#F2EFE8`.

4. THE App SHALL replace the legacy `--bg-primary: #080D1A` token with `--ink: #0C0E14` as the primary background.
5. THE App SHALL replace the legacy `--bg-secondary: #0D1528` token with `--lead: #1A1D27` as the card background.
6. THE App SHALL load Google Fonts for Syne (weights 700, 800), IBM Plex Sans (weights 400, 500, 600), and IBM Plex Mono (weights 400, 500, 600) via the `fonts.css` or `index.html` file.
7. WHEN any component uses a color that was previously `#3B7BF6`, THE App SHALL render that element in `#00D4FF` (Volt) after the redesign.

4. THE NavigationBar SHALL use IBM Plex Sans 500 for all nav link text.
5. WHEN rendered on a viewport width of 375px, THE NavigationBar SHALL collapse nav links and display only the logo and AMD_Badge.

---

### Requirement 4: Landing Page — Hero Section

**User Story:** As a prospective user, I want an editorially bold landing page with a left-aligned hero on desktop, so that the product feels distinctive and authoritative rather than generic SaaS.

2. THE App SHALL install and use framer-motion for the DocumentStack spring physics animation.
3. THE DocumentStack SHALL render each PaperCard with background `--paper` (#F2EFE8), a slight random rotation between -4° and +4°, and a drop shadow to suggest physical depth.
4. THE PaperCard SHALL display a file-type stamp badge ("PDF" or "IMG") using IBM Plex Mono, the filename in IBM Plex Sans, and the file size in IBM Plex Mono.
5. THE DocumentStack SHALL use framer-motion spring physics (stiffness and damping) for card entry and removal animations.

---

### Requirement 15: Color Constraint — AMD Signal Reserved Usage

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the AMD red (#ED1C24) strictly reserved for AMD badges, conflict alerts, and critical/HIGH risks, so that its presence always signals something important and never dilutes through general UI use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE App SHALL only use `--amd-signal` (#ED1C24) for: AMD_Badge components, ConflictAlert borders and labels, HIGH risk badge backgrounds and text, and critical alert icons.
2. THE App SHALL use `--error` (#EF4444) — not `--amd-signal` — for standard UI error states such as form validation errors, upload errors, and general error messages.

4. THE App SHALL call `exportReport()` via `POST /api/report` and trigger a file download of the returned Blob.
5. THE App SHALL call `getDemoData()` via `GET /api/demo` and populate the Demo_Page with the returned `DemoResponse`.
6. THE App SHALL call `getSuggestedQuestions()` via `POST /api/suggest-questions` and populate the Chat_Page quick questions panel.
7. IF any API call returns a non-2xx status, THEN THE App SHALL display a toast notification with the error message using `sonner`.
8. THE App SHALL preserve all existing TypeScript types in `src/lib/types.ts` without modification: `UploadedDocument`, `UploadResponse`, `Risk`, `Conflict`, `ComparisonRow`, `Recommendation`, `Analysis`, `AnalyzeResponse`, `Evidence`, `StructuredAIResponse`, `ChatResponse`, `PreSeededMessage`, and `DemoResponse`.

2. WHILE the viewport width is less than 768px, THE Dashboard_Page SHALL hide the sidebar and present a toggle button in the breadcrumb row to open it as a bottom sheet or drawer.
3. WHILE the viewport width is less than 768px, THE Chat_Page SHALL occupy the full screen height with the input bar fixed at the bottom and quick question chips scrollable horizontally above the input bar.
4. WHILE the viewport width is less than 768px, THE Demo_Page SHALL collapse into a single-column layout with the document sidebar accessible via a drawer toggle.
5. THE App SHALL use `clamp()` or responsive breakpoint classes for all headline font sizes across all four pages.
