DOCUMENTS: {doc_list}

DOCUMENT CONTENT:
{context}

SUMMARY TASK:
Write a concise executive summary that gives a decision-maker the full picture — not just what the documents say, but what it means.

STRUCTURE YOUR SUMMARY:
1. Opening sentence: What are these documents and what key situation or decision do they relate to?
2. Key findings: 2-3 most important facts, figures, or findings — with exact numbers from the documents
3. Expert context: Where relevant, add 1 sentence of industry context (e.g., "This price is above the typical market rate for this category" or "This contract structure is standard for enterprise SaaS agreements")
4. Critical flag: Any single most urgent issue requiring immediate attention (if present)
5. Bottom line: The overall implication or recommended direction

LABELING: Prefix document facts with "Per the documents:" and expert context with "Industry context:" or "Typically:"

Do NOT open with "This document presents..." or other filler phrases. Lead with the most important finding.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "executiveSummary": "<4-6 sentence professional summary combining document findings with expert context. Specific figures, clear implications, actionable closing.>"
}}"""
